# Anime_seek

## Overview

Anime_seek is a college group project that marks our initiation into using Django for backend development. This project was undertaken as part of the Web Interfaces for Data Management course at ISCTE. My colleague, Beatriz Paulino, and I collaborated to create a web application designed as an anime repository and social media platform to anime enthusiasts

# Features

- User Roles:
Otaku: Regular users of the app who can add anime to their watchlist, comment on anime, and manage their friend list.
Admin: Users with administrative privileges responsible for adding new anime entries to the repository and other privilegies

- Functionality:
Anime List: Otaku users can build and manage their anime watchlist.
Comments: Users can leave comments on anime entries, fostering a community-driven experience.
Friend Management: Otaku users have the ability to add or remove friends within the platform.

# Future Enhancements

One of the planned future enhancements for Anime_seek is the implementation of a "track back" functionality. This feature aims to enable users to keep track of the episodes they have watched for each anime in their watchlist.
